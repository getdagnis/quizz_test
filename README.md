#Job Interview Quizz Test

The task was to build a JavaScript Quizz application that:
1) Has a name input field for the User to fill in (validation etc. was not required)
2) Connects to their API to fetch ALL the quizzes stored on their server
3) Populates the fetched quizzes with all of the questions, and questions with answers
4) Stores user answers and shows a progress bar for the questions
5) Shows a report card at the end informing how many questions were answered correctly (which ones exactly were correct was not directly provided by their API, I had to hack around it a bit to get that shown)

- This project is built solely with HTML/CSS and pure Vanilla JS.
- It is built as a dynamically static, serverless, single page application that only uses solely JS to populate a virtual, restful DOM, that doesn't reload at any point
- This project uses no pre-built scripts or any JS libraries/frameworks. All code is 100% written by myself && offline
- This is my FIRST fully finished Vanilla JS project less than a year after beginning to learn JavaScript
- This is probably also my LAST purely Vanilla JS written project as I'm looking forward to dig deeper into React, Angular, Vue and/or Svelte
