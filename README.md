#Printful Quizz Test

- This project is built solely with HTML/CSS and pure Vanilla JS.
- It is built as a dynamically static, serverless, single page application and uses solely JS to populate a virtual, stateless, restful DOM, that doesn't reload at any point
- This project uses no pre-built scripts or any JS librariers/frameworks
- XHR requests are done using async fetch() requests
- Given more time, the async requests should be improved, as they tend to malfunction on longer response times at some points. This is a TODO for the future if this project has any future ahead
- Other than that, thanks for the given opportunity!

Sincerely,
Dagnis
