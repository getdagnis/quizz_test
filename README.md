#Job Interview Quizz Test

The task was to build a JavaScript application that:
1) Has a name input field (validation etc. was not required)
2) Connects to their API to fetch the quiz titles
3) Populate the fetched quiz questions and possible answers
4) Show a progress bar
5) Show a report card with how many questions were answered correctly (which ones exactly were correct was not directly provided by their API, I had to hack around a bit to get that shown)

- This project is built solely with HTML/CSS and pure Vanilla JS.
- It is built as a dynamically static, serverless, single page application that only uses solely JS to populate a virtual, restful DOM, that doesn't reload at any point
- This project uses no pre-built scripts or any JS libraries/frameworks. All code is 100% written by myself && offline
- This is my FIRST fully finished Vanilla JS project less than a year after beginning to learn JavaScript
- This is probably also my LAST purely Vanilla JS written project as I'm looking forward to dig deeper into React, Angular, Vue and/or Svelte
